This React Native bug arises when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data. The issue is that AsyncStorage's `getItem` method returns a promise that resolves to a string, even if the stored value was a number or an object. This can lead to unexpected type errors in the rest of the code. For example, if you're expecting a number but get a string, comparing the value or doing any calculations with it could fail.
